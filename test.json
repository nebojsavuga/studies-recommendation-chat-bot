Programming paradigms are often idiomatic and construe epistemological values about the structuring of applications, reusable code libraries and patterns that lead to architectural decisions. Object-Orientation is a paradigmatic perspective on how to organize data and routines into libraries of reusable code centered on organization of data and routines into containers called classes (for specification) and objects (for instantiation). As such, the focus here is on manifested applications that extend from design to implementation whereas systems analysis and design stops short, in most cases, of implementation. Object-oriented programming requires baseline competencies related to (1) Fundamental elements of objects and classes, (2) Instantiation modalities, (3) Intra-entity communication and messaging, (4) Encapsulation, (5) Inheritance and dependency management, (6) Abstraction, (7) Polymorphism, (8) Design Patterns, and (9) Modeling.",

Programming paradigms are often idiomatic and construe epistemological values about the structuring of applications, reusable code libraries and patterns that lead to architectural decisions. Object-Orientation is a paradigmatic perspective on how to organize data and routines into libraries of reusable code centered on organization of data and routines into containers called classes (for specification) and objects (for instantiation). As such, the focus here is on manifested applications that extend from design to implementation whereas systems analysis and design stops short, in most cases, of implementation. Object-oriented programming requires baseline competencies related to (1) Fundamental elements of objects and classes, (2) Instantiation modalities, (3) Intra-entity communication and messaging, (4) Encapsulation, (5) Inheritance and dependency management, (6) Abstraction, (7) Polymorphism, (8) Design Patterns, and (9) Modeling.",

Programming paradigms are often idiomatic and construe epistemological values about the structuring of applications, reusable code libraries and patterns that lead to architectural decisions. Object-Orientation is a paradigmatic perspective on how to organize data and routines into libraries of reusable code centered on organization of data and routines into containers called classes (for specification) and objects (for instantiation). As such, the focus here is on manifested applications that extend from design to implementation whereas systems analysis and design stops short, in most cases, of implementation. Object-oriented programming requires baseline competencies related to (1) Fundamental elements of objects and classes, (2) Instantiation modalities, (3) Intra-entity communication and messaging, (4) Encapsulation, (5) Inheritance and dependency management, (6) Abstraction, (7) Polymorphism, (8) Design Patterns, and (9) Modeling.",

Object-Orientation is a paradigmatic perspective on how to organize data and routines into libraries of reusable code centered on organization of data and routines into containers called classes (for specification) and objects (for instantiation). As such, the focus here is on manifested applications that extend from design to implementation whereas systems analysis and design stops short, in most cases, of implementation.

Programming paradigms are often idiomatic and construe epistemological values about the structuring of applications, reusable code libraries and patterns that lead to architectural decisions. Object-Orientation is a paradigmatic perspective on how to organize data and routines into libraries of reusable code centered on organization of data and routines into containers called classes (for specification) and objects (for instantiation). As such, the focus here is on manifested applications that extend from design to implementation whereas systems analysis and design stops short, in most cases, of implementation. Object-oriented programming requires baseline competencies related to (1) Fundamental elements of objects and classes, (2) Instantiation modalities, (3) Intra-entity communication and messaging, (4) Encapsulation, (5) Inheritance and dependency management, (6) Abstraction, (7) Polymorphism, (8) Design Patterns, and (9) Modeling.",

As such, the focus here is on manifested applications that extend from design to implementation whereas systems analysis and design stops short, in most cases, of implementation.

Object-Orientation is a paradigmatic perspective on how to organize data and routines into libraries of reusable code centered on organization of data and routines into containers called classes (for specification) and objects (for instantiation). As such, the focus here is on manifested applications that extend from design to implementation whereas systems analysis and design stops short, in most cases, of implementation.

The area comprises two facets: Ethics and IS sustainability. Ethics, within the information systems ecosystem, reflects agreed moral codes of practices and control associated with the use of information systems through the collection of data, the creation and storage, and its sharing of information. The information system practitioner must be cognizant of these ethical codes and its implications for society. IS sustainability, through its design, implementation, and use of computing resources, reflects an imperative that such systems and their data sources must be adaptable, relevant to all stakeholders, and support the maintenance of data captured by such systems.",

Programming paradigms are often idiomatic and construe epistemological values about the structuring of applications, reusable code libraries and patterns that lead to architectural decisions. Object-Orientation is a paradigmatic perspective on how to organize data and routines into libraries of reusable code centered on organization of data and routines into containers called classes (for specification) and objects (for instantiation). As such, the focus here is on manifested applications that extend from design to implementation whereas systems analysis and design stops short, in most cases, of implementation. Object-oriented programming requires baseline competencies related to (1) Fundamental elements of objects and classes, (2) Instantiation modalities, (3) Intra-entity communication and messaging, (4) Encapsulation, (5) Inheritance and dependency management, (6) Abstraction, (7) Polymorphism, (8) Design Patterns, and (9) Modeling.",

                "description": "The Object-Orientation area focuses on software implementations that extend beyond simple utilization of programming constructs and move toward the utilization of modular components often built against paradigmatic best practices for extensible and manageable construction. Programming paradigms are often idiomatic and construe epistemological values about the structuring of applications, reusable code libraries and patterns that lead to architectural decisions. Object-Orientation is a paradigmatic perspective on how to organize data and routines into libraries of reusable code centered on organization of data and routines into containers called classes (for specification) and objects (for instantiation). As such, the focus here is on manifested applications that extend from design to implementation whereas systems analysis and design stops short, in most cases, of implementation. Object-oriented programming requires baseline competencies related to (1) Fundamental elements of objects and classes, (2) Instantiation modalities, (3) Intra-entity communication and messaging, (4) Encapsulation, (5) Inheritance and dependency management, (6) Abstraction, (7) Polymorphism, (8) Design Patterns, and (9) Modeling.",

Programming paradigms are often idiomatic and construe epistemological values about the structuring of applications, reusable code libraries and patterns that lead to architectural decisions. Object-Orientation is a paradigmatic perspective on how to organize data and routines into libraries of reusable code centered on organization of data and routines into containers called classes (for specification) and objects (for instantiation). As such, the focus here is on manifested applications that extend from design to implementation whereas systems analysis and design stops short, in most cases, of implementation. Object-oriented programming requires baseline competencies related to (1) Fundamental elements of objects and classes, (2) Instantiation modalities, (3) Intra-entity communication and messaging, (4) Encapsulation, (5) Inheritance and dependency management, (6) Abstraction, (7) Polymorphism, (8) Design Patterns, and (9) Modeling.",
