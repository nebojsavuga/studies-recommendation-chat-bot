considerations in creating an effective project plan from its start to its completion. (Project management)

**ITE-IMA Information Management**
 - Express how the growth of the internet and demands for information have changed data handling and transactional and
analytical processing and led to the creation of special-purpose databases. (Requirements). Design and implement a physical model based on appropriate organization rules for a given scenario including the impact of
normalization and indexes. (Requirements and development). Create working SQL statements for simple and intermediate queries to create and modify data and database objects to store,
manipulate, and analyze enterprise data. (Testing and performance). Analyze ways data fragmentation, replication, and allocation affect database performance in an enterprise environment.
(Integration and evaluation). Perform major database administration tasks such as create and manage database users, roles and privileges, backup, and
restore database objects to ensure organizational efficiency, continuity, and information security. (Testing and performance)

**ITE-IST Integrated Systems Technology**
 - Illustrate how to code and store characters, images, and other forms of data in computers and show why data conversion is
often a necessity when merging disparate computing systems. (Data mapping and exchange). Show how a commonly used intersystem communication protocol works, including its advantages and disadvantages.
(Intersystem communication protocols). Design, debug and test a script that includes selection, repetition, and parameter passing. (Integrative programming and
scripting). Illustrate the goals of secure coding and show how to use these goals as guideposts in dealing with preventing buffer overflow,
wrapper code, and securing method access. (Defensible integration)

**ITE-NET Networking**
 - Analyze and compare the characteristics of various communication protocols and how they support application requirements
within a telecommunication system. (Requirements and Technologies). Analyze and compare several networking topologies in terms of robustness, expandability, and throughput used within a cloud
enterprise. (Technologies). Describe different network standards, components, and requirements of network protocols within a distributed computing
setting. (Network protocol technologies). Produce managerial policies to address server breakdown issues within a banking system. (Risk Management). Explain different main issues related to network management. (Network Management)

**ITE-PFT Platform Technologies**
 - Describe how the historical development of hardware and
operating system computing platforms produced the computing
systems we have today. (Computing systems). Show how to choose among operating system options, and install
at least an operating system on a computer device. (Operating
systems). Justify the need for power and heat budgets within an IT
environment, and document the factors needed when considering
power and heat in a computing system. (Computing
infrastructure). Produce a block diagram, including interconnections, of the main
parts of a computer, and illustrate methods used on a computer
for storing and retrieving data. (Architecture and organization)

**ITE-SPA System Paradigms **
- Justify the way IT systems within an organization can represent
stakeholders using different architectures and the ways these
architectures relate to a system lifecycle. (Requirements and
development). Demonstrate a procurement process for software and hardware
acquisition and explain the procedures one might use for testing
the critical issues that could affect IT system
performance. (Testing and performance). Evaluate integration choices for middleware platforms and
demonstrate how these choices affect testing and evaluation
within the development of an IT system. (Integration and
evaluation). Use knowledge of information technology and sensitivity to the
goals and constraints of the organization to develop and monitor
effective and appropriate system administration policies within a
government environment. (System governance). Develop and implement procedures and employ technologies to
achieve administrative policies within a corporate environment.
(Operational activities). Organize personnel and information technology resources into
appropriate administrative domains in a technical center.
(Operational domains). Use appropriate and emerging technologies to improve
performance of systems and discover the cause of performance
problems in a system. (Performance analysis)

**ITE-SWF Software Fundamentals**
 - Use multiple levels of abstraction and select appropriate data
structures to create a new program that is socially relevant and
requires teamwork. (Program development). Evaluate how to write a program in terms of program style,
intended behavior on specific inputs, correctness of program
components, and descriptions of program functionality. (App
development practices). Develop algorithms to solve a computational problem and
explain how programs implement algorithms in terms of
instruction processing, program execution, and running
processes. (Algorithm development). Collaborate in the creation of an interesting and relevant app
(mobile or web) based on user experience design, functionality,
and security analysis and build the app’s program using standard
libraries, unit testing tools, and collaborative version control.
(App development practices)

**ITE-UXD User Experience Design**
 - Design an interactive application, applying a user-centered design
cycle and related tools and techniques (e.g., prototyping), aiming
at usability and relevant user experience within a corporate
environment. (Design tools and techniques). For a case of user centered design, analyze and evaluate the context
of use, stakeholder needs, state-of-the-art interaction
opportunities, and envisioned solutions, considering user attitude
and applying relevant tools and techniques (e.g., heuristic
evaluation), aiming at universal access and inclusiveness, and
showing a responsive design attitude, considering assistive
technologies and culture sensitive design. (Stakeholder needs). For evaluation of user-centered design, articulate evaluation
criteria and compliance to relevant standards (Benchmarks and
standards). In design and analysis, apply knowledge from related disciplines
including human information processing, anthropology and
ethnography, and ergonomics/human factors. (Integrative design). Apply experience design for a service domain related to several
disciplines, focusing on multiple stakeholders and collaborating in
an interdisciplinary design team. (Application design)

**ITE-WMS Web and Mobile Systems** 
 - Design a responsive web application utilizing a web framework
and presentation technologies in support of a diverse online
community. (Web application development). Develop a mobile app that is usable, efficient, and secure on more
