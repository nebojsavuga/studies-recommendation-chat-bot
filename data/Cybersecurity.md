**Software Security**
The Software Security knowledge area focuses on the development and use of software
that reliably preserves the security properties of the information and systems it protects.
The security of a system, and of the data it stores and manages, depends in large part on
the security of its software. The security of software depends on how well the
requirements match the needs that the software is to address, how well the software is
designed, implemented, tested, and deployed and maintained.

advantage of using secure coding techniques.

**Component Security**
The Component Security knowledge area focuses on the design, procurement, testing,
analysis and maintenance of components integrated into larger systems.  
The security of a system depends, in part, on the security of its components. The security
of a component depends on how it is designed, fabricated, procured, tested, connected to
other components, used and maintained. This knowledge area is primarily concerned with
the security aspects of the design, fabrication, procurement, testing and analysis of
components. Together with the Connection Security and System Security KAs, the
Component Security KA addresses the security issues of connecting components and
using them within larger systems.
Essentials - Vulnerabilities of system components, - Component lifecycle, - Secure component design principles, - Supply chain management security, - Security testing, and - Reverse engineering
Learning outcomes: Explain how the security of a system’s components might impact
the security of the system.
Describe ways in which the confidentiality of a component’s design
may be compromised.
Describe ways to learn information about component’s
functionality with limited information about its design and
implementation. List the phases of a component’s lifecycle.

**Connection Security**
The Connection Security knowledge area focuses on the security of the connections
between components including both physical and logical connections.  
It is critical that every cybersecurity professional have a basic knowledge of digital
communications and networking. Connections are how components interact. Much of this
material could be introduced through examples, and then abstracting to the essentials and
introducing the appropriate vocabulary. the Connection Security KA addresses the security issues of
connecting components and using them within larger systems
Systems, architecture, models, and standards, - Physical component interfaces, - Software component interfaces, - Connection attacks, and - Transmission attacks
Learning outcomes: Discuss the need for common models and architectures in order to
describe systems.
Describe a model of systems that consists of components and
interfaces for connections.
Explain why a component requires at least one interface.
List several standards that define models consisting of systems of
components and interfaces.
Describe the components and interfaces of a networking standard
provided. Explain how connection attacks can be understood in terms of
attacks on software component interfaces.

**System Security**
The System Security knowledge area focuses on the security aspects of systems that are
composed of components and connections, and use software. Understanding the security
of a system requires viewing it not only as a set of components and connections, but also
as a complete unit in and of itself. This requires a holistic view of the system. the System Security KA
addresses the security issues of connecting components and using them within larger
systems Essentials - Holistic approach, - Security policy, - Authentication, - Access control, - Monitoring, - Recovery, - Testing, and - Documentation. Learning oucomes: Explain the concepts of trust and trustworthiness.
Explain what is meant by confidentiality, integrity, and
availability.
Explain what a security policy is, and its role in protecting data
and resources.
Discuss the importance of a security policy.
Explain why different sites have different security policies.
Describe an access control list.
Describe physical and logical access control, and compare and
contrast them. Describe what a penetration test is and why it is valuable.
Discuss how to document a test that reveals a vulnerability.

**Human Security**
The Human Security knowledge area focuses on protecting individuals’ data and privacy
in the context of organizations (i.e., as employees) and personal life, in addition to the
study of human behavior as it relates to cybersecurity.
Humans have responsibility to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA)
of their organizational and personal computer systems, while that responsibility is
dependent upon each of the Human Security knowledge units outlined below.
Essentials - Identity management, - Social engineering, - Awareness and understanding, - Social behavioral privacy and security, and - Personal data privacy and security. Students are required to demonstrate proficiency in each of the essential concepts through achievement of the learning outcomes. Learning outcomes:
Explain the difference between identification, authentication, and
access authorization of people and devices.
Discuss the importance of audit trails and logging in identification
and authentication.
Demonstrate the ability to implement the concept of least privilege
and segregation of duties.

education, as well as cyber vulnerabilities and threats awareness.
Describe the major topics within Security Education, Training,
and Awareness (SETA) programs.

**Organizational Security**
The Organizational Security knowledge area focuses on protecting organizations from
cybersecurity threats and managing risk to support the successful accomplishment of the
organization’s mission. Organizations have responsibility to meet the needs of many
constituencies and those needs must inform each of these knowledge units.
Students should be able to identify the types of security laws, regulations, and standards
within which an organization operates. A government organization has a set of security
profiles while a corporate entity has other focuses.
Essentials - Risk management, - Governance and policy, - Laws, ethics, and compliance, and - Strategy and planning.
Students are required to demonstrate proficiency in each of the essential concepts through
achievement of the learning outcomes. Learning outcomes:
Describe risk management and its role in the organization.
Describe risk management techniques to identify and prioritize
risk factors for information assets and how risk is assessed.

Describe why ethical codes of conduct are important to
cybersecurity professionals and their organizations.

**Societal Security**
The Societal Security knowledge area focuses on aspects of cybersecurity that broadly
impact society as a whole for better or for worse. Cybercrime, law, ethics, policy, privacy
and their relation to each other are the key concepts of this knowledge area. The threat of
cybercrime across the global society is incredibly serious and growing. Laws, ethics and
policies are vital to the security of corporate and government secrets and assets, as well as
to the protection of individual privacy and identity.
