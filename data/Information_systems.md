# Information systems (IS)

**Data and Information Management**
The Data and Information Management area comprises competencies related to tools and
techniques for managing data with database systems. At the highest level, competencies within
this area are related to two questions: (1) how to use a database and (2) how to build a database.
Most of this competency area will focus on the classic relational model. In the past several years,
driven by evolving functional and non-functional (quality) needs of an organization, alternatives to
the classic relational model have emerged. Illustrative samples will be examined of these popular
alternatives known as non-relational or NoSQL models.
Electives: Following the trend toward big data and analytics, there is increasing need for
professionals in this area and thus opportunities for specialization. While specialized programs
exist that produce data scientists, this area has also emerged as an important area for graduates
from IS programs

**Data and Business Analytics**: Big Data is differentiated from traditional data in terms of the three
‘V’s: volume, velocity, and variety. When data are processed at the terabyte and petabyte level
(volume) what fundamental shift in the approach to solving problems occurs? Given the fast
transmission and computational speeds of current systems (velocity), what new capabilities are
enabled by the processing of huge amounts of data in real time? Estimates are that more than
90% of the world’s data is not structured (variety); what type of new actionable insights are
facilitated by the processing of semi-structured (e.g., csv, JSON) and unstructured (e.g., text,
images, audio) data? To answer these questions, graduates will need data driven actionable
competencies, such as (1) apply the principles of computational thinking (CT) to learning data
science, (2) analyze data science problems with a CT framework, (3) express a business problem
as a data problem (4) perform exploratory data analysis from inception to the value proposition,
(5) explain the core principles behind various analytics tasks such as classification, clustering,
optimization, recommendation, (6) articulate the nature and potential of Big Data, and (7)
demonstrate the use of big data tools on real world case-studies.

**Data and Information Visualization**
The Data
and Information Visualization competency area contains competencies pertaining to
computational approaches for gaining insight via visualizations. Competencies in this area
emphasize the fundamentals of statistical exploration of data, fitting models to produce
specialized graphs to support the exploration of data in a detailed and statistics-oriented manner,
and the use of data visualization tools such as Excel, Python, R, and Tableau.
Naturally, these three areas should not be considered as providing an exhaustive coverage
necessary for acute specialization. Rather, they are provided as illustrative examples, where
specialization should be supported and augmented with competencies from other disciplines
related to mathematics. Whether a program provides this additional support directly or indirectly
would be a localized choice.

**IT infrastructure**
IT infrastructure area covers all aspects of information technology infrastructure, as it is
used in the organization. IT infrastructure includes the design and development of suitable
architectures or servers, physical and cloud services, capacity planning, and networking. The
content covers the installation, configuration, maintenance, and management of all aspects of
technology from the server through to the organization’s network. A basic understanding of
Enterprise Architecture in the context of IT Infrastructure is also needed

**Secure Computing**
The Secure Computing area is concerned with practices associated with assuring secure
business operations in the context of adversaries. Assuring secure operations involves the
creation, operation, defense, analysis, and testing of secure computer systems. Hence secure
computing is an interdisciplinary area including aspects of computing, law, policy, human factors,
ethics, and risk management. The proposed competencies cover these areas, but with an IS
discipline lens. This includes data security, software security, human security, societal security,
and organization security.  
Following the need for an increased focus on infrastructure and security, the need for dedicated
professionals in IT and security consultancy provides a basis for further specialization. While
dedicated programs exist to produce cybersecurity specialists, IS auditing and security are
important related areas of need and demand for job placement of IS graduates. For building IS
competencies in this specialization, we propose one elective, to focus on Emerging Technologies.

**Emerging Technologies**
The Emerging Technologies area examines emerging technologies and explores their impact
on business and societal issues through a business and theoretical lens. A range of technologies
is identified and evaluated based on a range of business requirements based on a variety of
ethical, environmental, and sustainability perspectives. Technologies are practically applied to
enable suitable business opportunities.

**Systems Analysis and Design**
Systems Analysis and Design area examines various systems development
methodologies and modeling tools with an emphasis on object-oriented systems development
methods, software development life cycle (SDLC), and agile software development while
emphasizing analytical techniques to develop the correct definition of business problems and user
requirements. Topics should also include design, project management standards, information
gathering, effective communication and interpersonal skill development.

**Application Development and Programming**
The Application Development and Programming area comprises two facets: Programming and
Application Development:
Application Development is the purposeful application of programming fundamentals to craft
usable and useful software artifacts and systems to solve actionable business and organizational
problems where the power and automation of computing and data processing is warranted.  
Elements of design, to include reconciliation between human social systems and data and IS,
support a software/systems development life cycle where the industry and craft software
realization extend capabilities of software and programming code elements and our
understanding of fit and resonance with the human end-users of these systems.  
Programming is the language of computation and logic that sequences and orders instructions to
computing hardware in a manner that realizes both correct results and discernable results.  
Logical structures, algorithms, arithmetic facilities, and the ability to input, store, transform, and
output data that can be purposefully used to inform decisions and automated intentional
processes are at the heart of learning to program.

**Object-Orientation**
The Object-Orientation area focuses on software implementations that extend beyond simple
utilization of programming constructs and move toward the utilization of modular components
often built against paradigmatic best practices for extensible and manageable construction.  
Programming paradigms are often idiomatic and construe epistemological values about the
structuring of applications, reusable code libraries and patterns that lead to architectural
decisions. Object-Orientation is a paradigmatic perspective on how to organize data and routines
into libraries of reusable code centered on organization of data and routines into containers called
classes (for specification) and objects (for instantiation). As such, the focus here is on manifested applications that extend
from design to implementation whereas systems analysis and design stops short, in most cases,
of implementation. Object-oriented programming requires baseline competencies related to (1)
Fundamental elements of objects and classes, (2) Instantiation modalities, (3) Intra-entity
communication and messaging, (4) Encapsulation, (5) Inheritance and dependency
management, (6) Abstraction, (7) Polymorphism, (8) Design Patterns, and (9) Modeling.

**Web development**
The Web development area requires students to understand the concepts of web application
design and programming by learning the tools used to create client-side and server-side
programs. To design and implement a web site using current standards and best practices
requires students to (1) Understand how the Internet works, (2) Create and analyze an algorithm
for effectiveness and efficiency, (3) Implement good documentation practices in programming, (4)
Demonstrate teamwork, interpersonal group skills, and team software development, (5) Develop
skills in client-side (Front-end) web application development technologies including HTML, CSS,
JavaScript, and JavaScript libraries, (6) Develop skills in server-side (back-end) web application
development technologies using a back-end programming language (i.e., Node/Express,
Python/Django, etc.), (7) Create a functioning web application suitable for portfolio presentation
including but not limited to skills shown using front-end, back-end, SQL, and current web
development tools, (8) Gain knowledge of different internet design patterns (i.e. MVC, MVVM,
etc.) and ability to know advantages and disadvantages of each

**Mobile development**
The Mobile development area focuses on the features and upcoming trends of the common
mobile platforms to develop a mobile application that uses a web services backend to synchronize
and centrally store user data. Topics include but not limited to human interface guidelines for
mobile development, tools required for mobile application development in different mobile
platforms. For mobile development, graduates need to (1) Understand the Internet of Things (IoT)
enabled devices and the mobile industry, (2) Create and analyze an algorithm for effectiveness
and efficiency, (3) Implement good documentation practices in programming, (4) Demonstrate
teamwork, interpersonal group skills, and team software development, (5) Develop skills in
commonly used mobile development languages like Kotlin, Java, JavaScript, C#, Objective-C,
HTML5, Swift, (6) Create a functioning mobile application suitable for portfolio presentation
including but not limited to skills shown using database management, hardware interaction, APIs,
cross platform development and current mobile development tools, (7) Gain knowledge of
different mobile development platforms, (8) Understand mobile user interface design and the user
experience, (9) Understand the how to implement cyber security measures for a mobile
application, (10) Implement an understanding of memory allocation and (13) Learn how to market and
publish a mobile application.

**User Interface Design**
The User Interface Design competency area emphasizes concepts and principles of user
interface design, design, and evaluation of user experiences (UX), and usability. Competencies
include psychological and interaction principles, requirements analysis, designing for different
screens, typography, symbols, color, graphics, and other visual language components.
Competencies in this area also include needs identification, system capabilities, and an
understanding of physical and mental limitations.

**IS Ethics, Sustainability, Use and Implications for Society**
The IS Ethics, Sustainability, Use and Implications for Society area is concerned with
practices associated with the ethical use of information systems and the ethical use of the
information and data captured by such systems; designing, implementing, and using computing
resources in a sustainable environmentally conscious manner; and competencies associated with
how information systems may be used and created for the benefit of society. The area comprises
two facets: Ethics and IS sustainability.  
Ethics, within the information systems ecosystem, reflects agreed moral codes of practices and
control associated with the use of information systems through the: collection of data, the creation
and storage, and its sharing of information.
The information system practitioner must be cognizant of these ethical codes and its implications
for society. IS sustainability, through its design, implementation, and use of computing resources, reflects an
imperative that such systems and their data sources must be adaptable, relevant to all
stakeholders, and support the maintenance of data captured by such systems

**IS Management and Strategy area**
The IS Management and Strategy area includes the capability to develop, maintain, and
consistently improve the systems to deliver the information necessary for an organization. The
capability focuses on creating value for an organization and on the IS staff motivation,
performance, and accountability. IS Strategy emphasizes the competency to create long-term
plans for implementing and using organizational information systems to achieve strategic
organizational goals and objectives. This area also covers monitoring and controlling
organizational IS resources to ensure alignment with and achievement of strategies, goals, and
objectives.

**Digital Innovation**
The Digital Innovation area focuses on competencies needed in the deployment of information
technologies to innovate and transform organizational processes and value offerings (products
and services). To participate in such innovation processes, graduates need competencies related
to how digital innovations are being created, distributed, and commercialized. This requires
understanding of both theoretical and practical aspects of emerging and existing digital
innovation, their potential impact, disruption, and transformation on business and society.
graduates will need to be able to (1) Articulate and critically reflect on the
unique features that an application of emerging technology may offer, (2) Demonstrate knowledge
of the role of digital business technologies in social and mobile domains, (3) Identify and critique
characteristics necessary for digital innovation, (4) Identify and validate an opportunity to develop
a new digital business model, (5) Identify and evaluate key issues related to implementation and
infrastructure issues, (6) Identify and assemble the required resources, processes, and partners
to bring a digital business model to fruition, and (7) Practically demonstrate the investigation and
application of a new innovation.

**Project Management**
The Project Management area provides an understanding of the concepts of project
management and appropriate project management techniques in dealing with IS management.
Topics include principles of project management, project management functions, project
management processes, selecting an appropriate project management methodology, agile
software development principles, and scrum. Emphasis is placed on understanding and gaining
practical knowledge of key project management skills: integration management, scope
management, time management, cost management, quality management, human resource
management, communications management, and risk management. Emphasis is also placed on
understanding iterative development processes and decision criteria for choosing between
planned and agile project management approaches. To contribute to project management,
students need to learn the tools, techniques, and processes to manage project performance along
with moving from one phase to another until the closure of the project.

**IS Practicum**
The IS Practicum area is an applied synthesis of foundational courses related to exercising
design and applying one or more media of construction to effect and implement an IS artifact to
suit client or organizational needs. Emphasis on the application of data management, application
development, IT infrastructure, and IT Project Management. Students work in teams and apply
a software/systems development paradigm toward the development of a system prototype to
satisfy the intentions and needs of an organizational client. Client interaction, often best facilitated
via the use of Agile software methods, must be sustained and ongoing such that emergence in
design and development can be experienced.
