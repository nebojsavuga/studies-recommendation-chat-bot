architectural and design patterns.
4. Produce detailed designs for a client for specific subsystem high-level designs by using design principles and cross-cutting
aspects to satisfy functional and non-functional requirements.

planners, or maintainers.

**Software Construction**
1. Design and implement an API using an object-oriented language and extended libraries, including parameterization and
generics on a small project.
2. Evaluate a software system against modern software practices such as defensive programming, error and exception handling,
accepted fault tolerances, in a runtime mode that considers state-based table-driven constructions on a large project, as a
member of a project team.
3. Develop a distributed cloud-based system that incorporates grammar-based inputs and concurrency primitives for a mediumsize project and then conduct a performance analysis to fine-tune the system, as a member of a project team.

**Software Testing**
1. Perform an integrative test and analysis of software components by using black-box and use case techniques in collaboration
with the clients.
2. Conduct a regressive test of software components for a client that considers operational profiles and quality attributes specific
to an application following empirical data and the intended usages.
3. Conduct a test utilizing appropriate testing tools focused on desirable quality attributes specified by the quality control team
and the client.
4. Plan and conduct process to design test cases for an organization using both clear- and black-box techniques to measure quality
metrics in terms of coverage and performance. 

**Software Sustainment**
1. Describe the criteria for transition into a sustainment status and assist in identifying applicable systems and software
operational standards.
2. Relate to the needs of operational support personnel for documentation and training and help develop software transition
documentation and operational support training materials.
3. Help in determining the impacts of software changes on the operational environment.
4. Describe the elements of software support activities, such as configuration management, operational software assurance, help
desk activities, operational data analysis, and software retirement.
5. Perform software support activities; and interact effectively with other software support personnel.
6. Assist in implementing software maintenance processes and plans and make changes to software to implement maintenance
needs and requests.

**Software Process and Life Cycle**
1. Engage with a team to translate a software development process into individual areas of responsibility.
2. Commit to and perform tasks related to assigned or agreed-upon areas of responsibility.
3. Propose and justify software lifecycle process improvements based on team capacity, project progress data, and quality
analysis as part of a software development team's retrospective activities.

**Software Systems Engineering**
1. Provide a description of system engineering concepts and activities to identify problems or opportunities, explore alternatives,
create models, and test them.
2. Develop the big picture of a system in its context and environment to simplify and improve system architectures for supporting
system designers.
3. Develop interfaces, which interact with other subsystems. Use information hiding to isolate the contents and collaborations
within subsystems, so that clients of the subsystem need not be aware of the internal design of subsystems.
4. Work effectively with engineers and developers from other disciplines to ensure effective interaction.

**Software Quality**
1. Distinguish quality attributes that are discernable at run-time (performance, security, availability, functionality, usability),
from those not discernable at run-time (modifiability, portability, reusability, integrability, and testability) and those related
to the intrinsic qualities of architecture and detailed design (conceptual integrity, correctness, and completeness).
2. Design, coordinate, and execute, within a project team, software quality assurance plans for small software subsystems and
modules, considering how quality attributes are discernable. Correspondingly, measure, document, and communicate
appropriately the results.
3. Perform peer code reviews for evaluating quality attributes that are not discernable at run-time.
4. Explain the statistical nature of quality evaluation when performed on software execution; develop, deploy, and implement
approaches to collect statistical usage and testing outcome data; compute and analyze statistics on outcome data.
5. Interact with external entities including clients, users, and auditing agencies in conveying quality goals for processes and
products.

**Software Security**
1. Apply the project’s selected security lifecycle model (e.g., Microsoft SDL), as a contributing member of a project team.
2. Identify security requirements by applying the selected security requirements method, as a contributing member of a software
project team.
3. Incorporate security requirements into architecture, high-level, and detailed design, as a contributing member of a software
project team.
4. Develop software using secure coding standards.
5. Execute test cases that are specific to security.
6. Adhere to the project’s software development process, as a contributing member of a software project team.
7. Develop software that supports the project’s quality goals and adheres to quality requirements.

**Software Safety**
1. Describe the principal activities with the development of software systems, which involve safety concerns (activities related
to requirements, design, construction, and quality).
2. Create and verify preliminary hazard lists; perform hazard and risk analyses, identify safety requirements.
3. Implement and verify design solutions, using safe design and coding practices, to assure that the hazards are mitigated, and
the safety requirements are met.
4. Be aware of the consequences of the development of unsafe software, that is, the negative effect on those who use or receive
services from the software.

and abilities.

**Project Management**
1. Explain the principal elements of management for a small project team.
2. Assist in the managerial aspects of a small project team, including software estimation, project planning, tracking, staffing,
resource allocation, and risk management.
3. Develop and implement plans for the measurement of software processes and work products using appropriate methods and

to professional and ethical expectations, and follows standard licensing practices.
4. Locate and make sense of learning resources, and use these to expand knowledge, skills, and dispositions. Reflect upon one’s
learning and how it provides a foundation for future growth.
